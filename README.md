## About this Project
### Origin
In one of my classes, I was given the option to either refactor a piece of exsiting code or write a program from scratch.  I chose the latter and thought it would be fun to write a card game.  I chose Blackjack due to its widespread popularity.

### Functionality
The player starts out with a balance of 100.  They can bet before each hand and double down if their initial deal is 11 (and they have enough money to place the bet).  As they play, their stats will be recorded (games, wins, losses, etc.).  If they lose all their money, they will be prompted to reset their stats where their balance returns to 100.
